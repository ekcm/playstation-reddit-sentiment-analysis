It's good, and no matter what adaptation is made of it, it will carry on existing, but adaptations do not need to be 1:1 up to the absurd. Especially if made by one of the original creators. All creatives will tell you if they had the opportunity to revisit something they made, they would probably change some stuff.\n\nIn general, people with such bigoted opinions are not that upfront, as they don't want to be called out, so they will hide behind things like biology, historical accuracy etc. A classic example I like to point at is Game of Throne. Some people complained that there were too many female lead roles, unrealistic according to them, given the medieval context. It's not a direct jab at feminism and so-called \"woke culture\", even though it really is that in the end, but it is hidden behind an historial question. A funny one, considering GoT isn't even trying to be historically accurate.\n\nThis episode of TLOU deviates a bit from the game, for sure. However, as you said it does not fundamentally change the story. It also paints a secondary character under a much more human light than the game. Originally, Bill is your good old survivalist, with a \"fuck you\" attitude. Quite a common trope in post-apocalyptic flicks. The TV shows makes him a lot more interesting & subtle. If anything, I wish this was the game's Bill.\n\nWe were warned certain things would be different from the game in the TV show. If that's the kind of deviations we get, I'm happy with that. It improves the Last of Us' universe, without taking anything away from it.",

Someone can dislike something with gay characters merely because it sucked and not because they are gay. TLOU 2 had a shit ton of lgbt characters and themes and people mostly hated because they killed Joel . I dont know why people always go to that conclusion",

Stop trying to create something out of nothing. \n\nAs someone who is Bi-Sexual, I‚Äôm tired of people dying on this hill of homophobia. \n\nPersonally I liked this episode. However, it would have been way better to see the Bloater in the high school gym. They missed out on an incredible moment in the game. This entire chapter from the game was perfect.  Bill should have lived, I wanted miserable Bill. I wanted the conversations between him and Ellie. It was really a missed opportunity.\n\nI think that‚Äôs why people were upset, this episode really didn‚Äôt stay true to the game at all, I know it‚Äôs not meant to be a 1:1, but this is one of the best parts in the entire game. Like I said, they truly missed out on some greatness."
