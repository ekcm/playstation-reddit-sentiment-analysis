They could have made us spend more time with Joel rather than kill him immediately without warning. The backstories should have happened in a different order to give characters like Abby a better character arc. The pacing got really slow at times. Deaths like Sam were extremely emotional in the first game even though we barely spent any time with him but deaths in tlou2 just felt cheap for the purpose of making the game have a sad vibe. Ellie spent the whole game trying to get revenge while everyone was getting killed only to let Abby go at the end? She shouldn't have gone for revenge again in the end. And even in the end, she couldn't forgive Joel? I mean Joel gave her purpose outside of being a walking vaccine.   \nIt is things like this that made people hate tlou2, not the fact that there were gay characters or strong female characters ( mean we already knew Ellie was gay, and we had strong female characters like Tess who could handle herself more than she needs). We can't blame developers' mistakes in making the game and say that people are homophobic if they didn't like it.",

Yeah that played a part but it is ignorant to say there's nothing else that someone might have disliked about the game. \n\nPeople still would have been mad about Joel, they still would have hated Abby, and they still wouldn't have liked the depressing tone that lingers from beginning to end. \n\nWould the reviews have been *better*? Sure. But there still would have been plenty of people upset and review bombing because most people lack the ability to provide nuanced takes. Everything is either perfect or it sucks. The amount of 2-4/5 star reviews is abysmally small in comparison to either the 1 or 5 star. \n\nI enjoyed the gameplay but yeah, the story didn't really resonate with me. It's a 7/10 at best meanwhile part 1 was a solid 9.5. Again, this is just me. I can understand and respect others may have enjoyed it more. \n\nDownvoting people who didn't like the game for valid reasons isn't productive or beneficial to anyone.",

But the series isn't a 10/10 just as much as it isn't a 1/10. \n\nPeople are giving it 10/10 just to try and combat all the 1/10s and other people are giving it 1/10 just to try and combat all the 10/10s. It's honestly just silly that people are turning the ratings into a game of tug a war.\n\nReally though, I think if we just take all the 10s and all the 1s out, we get a pretty accurate score. This episode isn't a 10/10, it's sitting at a 9 according to this screenshot. To me that sounds about right. It was a great episode, but let's not pretend is the single greatest episode to ever hit television. 9/10 is a great score.",

Even with all this, it's still sitting as one of the highest rated shows on IMDB.\n\n> The people rating it all 1’s started it. And they’d do it even if no one was rating it a 10.\n\nThe show started out as a 10/10 and was the highest rated TV show of all time on IMDB for a while, after only the very first episode aired.\n\nLet's be honest with ourselves. I like the show, and I disagree with the review bombing. I really do. But sitting back and looking in, it's laughable all the inner fighting you guys are having over a TV show rating on IMDB. People are taking this to heart as if their entire identity as a person is at risk. It's not that big of a deal. The pilot was fantastic, but you'll lose me if you try and claim this is the greatest TV show to ever bless my television screen. It's good, but these hyperboles are ridiculous.",

But I little action doesn’t hurt. The game is an action drama not a romance drama. If you look at the first 2 episodes the games cut out action and replaced it with lore that gave tlou universe more lore and more flavour  and I thought it was a Kevin’s move. Ex: ep 1 they replaces killing Robert men with explaining the fungi and giving Sarah more character which was incredible. \nEp2: they replaced the action in the tilting building with the conversation between Ellie and Joel and gave time to explain the hive mind concept while still retaining some of the action in the clicker killing scenes and the final explosion. \nBut ep 3 took out an entire part of the game that did world building introduced more enemies and great interactions with an filler like gay love story. \nNothing against it being a GAY love story. I would have been against a straight love story between Joel and Tess either way. The point is that tlou1 is not a romance, it had romantic relationships but that doesn’t make it a romance.",

I thought it was a good episode, just not the episode we deserved or the one we should have gotten. I mean Bill being gay was already established in the game. I would have been okay with some Frank and bill scenes, but not the whole episode god dammit. We missed the opportunity for Ellie to interact with bill and to see some action from bill's town (I mean the school part was insane!).  \nThey took a letter in the game and turned it into a gay love story that feels like a filler episode more than anything, and that was not the best approach. I feel like they should have given it the approach of the first 2 episodes where it is bill's town in a reimagined POV with some back story on bill and frank while still having some action (I mean you saw how cool the raiders scene was, so imagine how awesome a faithful adaptation of the action would have been). All I'm saying is, adapting one of the best parts of the game faithfully with some backstory of the love between frank and bill could have made this episode 10/10. I mean Bill's character was nothing like it was in the game. Like he fell in love with him in 1 day? Bill felt way too soft. He could have had the paranoia and a little softness and sweetness that would have given bill a nice different POV, but he just felt too much Hollywood gay stereotype. No offence to anyone but this episode barely had any effect on the show and felt more like a \"we have a gay character in our show, so we are not homophobic\" to get more attention from people and for people to praise the show, kind of like \"we just ticked one of our list of minorities to include in our show\".   \nThis is just my opinion, and it's not homophobic to have an opinion and want your favourite part of the game to get butchered like that. I hope we can respect each other's opinions without calling people homophobic for not liking the episode as much as you did.",

You can't just slap a \"this is just my opinion\" disclaimer and then make wild claims about a beloved character being a minority token or a stereotype that just exists to appease progressives. If the character or story didn't resonate with you, then *just say that*.\n\nEDIT: Just to remove some condescension here, when I say \"just say that,\" I specifically mean to break down the reasons why you felt that a character was a minority token or stereotypical in some other way instead of making broad unsubstantiated claims about what purpose or agenda that character serves.",

I’m saying instead of a full on emotional episode they could have implemented all the cool action while still having bits and bops from the backstory to add a softer and more emotional aspect to the episode and bill’s character. And I’m not saying the episode wasn’t good, in fact I loved it. But what I’m saying is that this episode felt out of place like a filler episode of sorts you know. I feel like bill’s town was some of the best of the game and them basically adapting nothing from it is incredibly disappointing. The reason people were praising the first 2 episodes so much was because the show tried to be faithful with a different mix of spices bringing a whole new amazing flavour to the last of us universe. But this episode was completely out of no where that I personally felt like a cheat, a way to say that the show is woke and not homophobic. Because the games already had many lgbt characters and bill was gay so it’s not like it’s a mega plot twist that came out of no where.  \n\nOnto your second point, like I said before BILL IS GAY. And the game showed that a gay character can be and ultimate badass, making him beloved even in the short time we’ve had with him (that’s why I was really looking forward to this episode, to see bill). \nOf course there are gonna be people who will state things and have nothing to back it up or just throw a statement and say that it’s an opinion. But that’s not me, and that’s not the majority of the people who played and loved this game so incredibly much. \nI’m not saying bill is a stereotype token for progressiveness. What I’m saying is that the episode just feels like it was some comic book that was made after the game to provide lore. The gay love story was just unexpected and tbh unnecessary. It didn’t really change the story and came in place of the opportunity to adapt greatness. \nI love bill and liked this episode, but the only way to describe this episode is filler. That’s the vibe it gave, it came out of no where with absolutely 0 relation to the game. \nSorry if I’m rambling but I’m really passionate about tlou1 because it’s so incredible and I jest felt robbed of the chance to see video game greatness become to greatness.",

I think its great that gays are getting represented in entertainment. I LOVED that the games were inclusive of gays, bisexuality AND transgender people. NONE of it felt forced in the game at all....they were just people who happened to be LGBT. Plenty of straight characters....plenty of different kinds of relationships displayed (lovers, friends, family) , it just felt real. But this episode? This episode had FILLER written all over it. It felt forced. It felt like it was shoving an agenda down my throat and I HATE that feeling no matter which side is doing the shoving. I feel like there are homophobes rating the episode 1/10....but thinking about it logically....most of the people watching and commenting are fans of the game....the game that had plenty of LGBT characters....I doubt a large portion of the fan base is homophobic. So you have a small group of people rating it low and then you have a significantly larger group rating it 10/10 just to combat the low ratings...which is wildly inflating the rating. I think its closer to a 7.0 which is STILL a good rating for a filler episode. I really am concerned for the future of the show if the audience genuinely thinks this was the best episode.",

I don't give a shit if people don't like something for legitimate reasons, but nobody can deny that these types of shows/movies/games are targeted by bigots with negative reviews, usually with veiled bigotry or phony criticisms.\n\nIf this episode had a straight couple instead of gay, there's zero chance there would be such a barrage of 1 star reviews.",

You call TV gay, and I posit that the issue is your mindset, not TV. You also can choose to turn it off and move on without ever thinking about it again, or wait until the next episode seeing as both gay men died.\n\nI suppose ask yourself: Would it have mattered as much if it were two women or a man and woman? For many people, it wouldn't have, I believe, and that's awfully silly to me.\n\nIf your issue is the title being click baity, well.. you are open to begin your own discussion.

If you just take all the story beats/cutscenes from the game and show them rapid fire, the pacing would probably feel way too fast without the interstitial bits of gameplay. Conversely trying to keep too much of trekking, lootin', and shootin' from the game in tact is also gonna be a challenge because narratively a lot less is going on and you don't have the gameplay to keep your viewer engaged.\n\nSo they have to walk a tightrope of following the story, while also rebuilding the connective tissue between those story beats in a way that's satisfying for everyone. Episode 3 was some full-on reconstructive surgery and I loved every second of it.",

I feel sorry for people who just see differences from the game's story and just have a gut reaction like, \"nooooo changes bad.\"\n\nI get wanting them to stay close to the source material. There are adaptions out there that take incredible stories and change things for no reason and just crash and burn (looking at you Witcher on Netflix). This was not one of those cases in my opinion. Episode 3 changed a lot from the game and made a better episode of TV for it",

I really liked the episode, I just thought the letter was a bit OTT with how directly it pointed out the development of Joel and Ellies relationship. The idea of a letter is fine, just the actual content was a bit blunty explaining the story development for me.\n\nIts a wider issue with tv and film not trusting their audiences to have a brain and something I hoped this show (given how mature and not very handholdy the games story delivery is) would avoid.\n\nLike the flashback in episode 1. Its only 45 odd minutes since we watched Joel see Sarah die and its a very poignant scene thats hard to forget within an hour. So later when you have another soldier standing the same way pointing a gun at Ellie and Joel looks back at her you *know* its a parallel to Sarah and if they just had Joel attack the soldier we would all know why. \n\nBut they couldn't just respect the audiences intelligence and do that, they had to put in the flashback to really just make sure that no one could possibly misunderstand and its just kind of insulting and damages naturally storytelling and letting the scene speak for itself. \n\nSame thing here with the letter. The ideas fine, but they were so on the nose with it telling Joel to protect Ellie (even literally calling him a protector) that it just lost a lot of its impact to me and I wish the show had the same respect for the audience the game did in trusting them to put it together themselves, especially when its really obvious like those two examples.",

I think \"the writers don't respect my intelligence\" only really becomes a big issue when it affects how the entire show is written, not just individual moments. Yes, maybe to you its obvious Joel has PTSD, but it might not be nearly as obvious to someone who's never played the game. It doesn't bother me at all that they put in a one second flashback there.

What I really wished would happen is if the writers pleased both parties. The lgbt and others (don’t have a name for them). The writers could have kept the first 2003 and 2007 backstories showing what bill was up to and how he fill in love with frank. Then they could’ve cut through the lunch, strawberry and death scenes (even though I loved them). They could’ve shown the raid, made it a bit shorter with FRANK being the one shot. Then cut to the present with Ellie and Joel arriving to be greeted with frank and bill. This would have built the paranoid character of bill while still retaining the sweet side that we got this episode. An in present day, instead of adapting all the action they could’ve made it that the infected that Ellie killed, triggered an attack which would follow them to bill’s town, they could’ve added a blister to the mix. And by the end of the episode bill could tell Joel the contents of the letter how he found purpose in life to protect frank and how Joel can have the same with protecting Ellie. There you go. An episode that serves everyone, pleases the lgbt community by having a gay kiss/sex scene and shows love, while pleasing the others by retaining some of the interactions and action that people wanted, with the message being delivered at the end. \nTHIS is a 10/10 episode not the one we got it stays true to the og material while having more lore and a different flavour to it. Because i cant believe that Neil said the action scenes were boring. There are literal the shows and movies based on action only and the last of us has everything. I mean if he wanted a romance he could’ve just made that in the beginning.",

And Joel saw the car as a piece of trash that might help them survive, while Ellie thought it was like a space ship. \n\nThe game never gave us that Frank, but this backstory gives huge insight into the role that Ellie will play for Joel, and how it will change Joel just as Frank changed Bill. IMO this episode was 100% faithful to all the characters, their values, and the story - with the only major change being all this extra detail that only serves to tell the same story in a better way. \n\nI’m sure the writers would have put this same sub story in the game if there was any way for them to do it in a fun way, but this would have made for mind numbing gaming.

In the game you play as Joel a lot in the beginning and Ellie is kind of an annoying smart ass putting you in danger. You have a lot of small bonding moments in passing through dialogue mid game play that combines with the larger scripted scenes to create that bond as a player to your companion.\n\nIn a show we aren't actively participating in Joels struggle. We are a third party witnessing what happens. They don't have the time to pack hours of small scenarios and dialogue bonding while also providing the scale of deadly that the world is. We get that through the opening scene about how a fungal outbreak is the true fear for the end of the world. We get that in episode 2 from our backstory with the scientist who confirms it's fungal and the only solution is to bomb everything. We see it from clickers, infected hordes being awoken in another location due to the \"roots\", from the absolute brutal nature the government handled the initial evacuations and citizens from shooting Sarah, to the killing field, the how the QZs are in general. \n\nSo the piece we were missing was \"why does Joel care about Ellie\". What we were given was a story of a doomsday prepper that was paranoid of everything and everyone. We watched him survive alone at the beginning of the outbreak. We watched him cautiously open his home to a strange man. We watched him open his heart to that same man while still being cautious of Frank's \"friends on the radio\" Joel and Tess. Bill and Joel met and saw part of themselves in each other. The need to harden yourself and be cold and brutal to survive. This episode though showed a cold and brutal man who found love and a life worth living and realized that was more important than just surviving to survive. So he passed that wisdom on to Joel, a man he believed to be like the old him, so that Joel can hopefully find a life worth living. \n\nIn general I think this needed to be how it was presented. If we had the same Bill from the game interacting with Joel and Ellie I'm not sure we would believe the Joel and Ellie relationship. I'm sure there are ways it could work but I'm not sure they can be done on such a small timescale (days, weeks?) of time.  This packaged the realization that Joel needed to make towards Ellie by using another characters history and delivering the message.",

My understanding was that Frank and Bill were friends who had a falling out and lived in the same trip wired town. I also understood “partner” in the sense of an associate or colleague… \n\nObviously, I have no problem with Frank and Bill being gay and I actually like how the show presented the narrative compared the game.

It's good, and no matter what adaptation is made of it, it will carry on existing, but adaptations do not need to be 1:1 up to the absurd. Especially if made by one of the original creators. All creatives will tell you if they had the opportunity to revisit something they made, they would probably change some stuff.\n\nIn general, people with such bigoted opinions are not that upfront, as they don't want to be called out, so they will hide behind things like biology, historical accuracy etc. A classic example I like to point at is Game of Throne. Some people complained that there were too many female lead roles, unrealistic according to them, given the medieval context. It's not a direct jab at feminism and so-called \"woke culture\", even though it really is that in the end, but it is hidden behind an historial question. A funny one, considering GoT isn't even trying to be historically accurate.\n\nThis episode of TLOU deviates a bit from the game, for sure. However, as you said it does not fundamentally change the story. It also paints a secondary character under a much more human light than the game. Originally, Bill is your good old survivalist, with a \"fuck you\" attitude. Quite a common trope in post-apocalyptic flicks. The TV shows makes him a lot more interesting & subtle. If anything, I wish this was the game's Bill.\n\nWe were warned certain things would be different from the game in the TV show. If that's the kind of deviations we get, I'm happy with that. It improves the Last of Us' universe, without taking anything away from it.",

Or James Bond. They'll tell you they aren't racist. Maybe they truly believe they aren't. But dig a little bit into their argument, and I guarantee you will find racism most of the time. The same way when you dig a bit among TLOU's haters (I have spent a lot of time on the other sub), you will usually find conservative values. More often than not, you don't need to dig at all.\n\nWhile I don't assume if someone did not like the episode they are necessarily homophobic, I know for a fact there is a high chance they are.",

Look at the negative comments about the episode. Full of the usual anti-woke crowd, who is heavily biased against non-binary characters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I mean have you thought about the fact that this is a complete deviation from the game?\n\nOf course I did. And it doesn't bother me at all, because it's not the game. The game is its own entity. That episode is different, but still looks & feel very TLOU-esque. Quite brilliantly, I would add.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Btw the reason people are angry at the little mermaid being black is not because they’re racist but because it’s not really accurate and feels like a cheap act from Disney to fell inclusive.\n\nHence having a problem with diversity. Regarding the point of accuracy, we're talking about a fictional character, in a queer story (google Andersen). I would say there is room for a black actress here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I simply can’t see the reason why?\n\nLove & death my friend. The bread & butter of drama, since antiquity. This one just happens to be gay too. Not an offense in my book. A capital one in many people's books.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Like I’ve seen so many black people saying black panther made them feel woke and empowered when it was just a movie.\n\nRepresentation works. I work in entertainment myself (game development, artist). Typically, entertainment, especially when the financial stakes are pretty high, does not take a lot of risks. It's boring for the creatives and for the audiences. Seeing your group being represented means you are not considered a risk anymore by stake holders, which is quite huge. I'm old enough to have known a time where protagonists had to be white, male and heterosexual. Deviating from that was possible, but very difficult. They did not want to rub the conservative audiences the wrong way. Those barriers are falling. Imagine gay people 40 years ago. They were vilified, called deviants, people said they all had AIDS and raped little boys. Mind you, some still say that. A TV show like the one you saw yesterday would have caused a huge backlash. We came a long way since, and we keep moving forward. Empowerment through representation is a reality.",

The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”\r  \n\r  \n― Jean-Paul Sartre",

That's the important part of my comment.\n\nI have debated quite a lot about that on several similar cases. For instance, I talked a lot with people who were adamant black actors in \"The Lord of the Rings\" TV show was a negative deviation from the source material. They talk about melanin, immigration among Hobbits etc. I met plenty of newfound freelance experts in ethnology within a certain part of audience. When challenging their points, I have always ended up finding the same root, they have a problem with diversity & inclusion policies. Not with the sheer realism of black Hobbits. Realism here is just an excuse. They don't care about the flight dynamics or diet of dragons. Their appreciation for realism is extremely selective, and limited to what they deem to be \"political points\".\n\nSomeone saying they don't like the show because it deviates too much from the source material would need to develop their point beyond reasonable doubt, which is contextual here, LOU being a hot topic. Most of the time, they don't take the time to do that. They say it's garbage because X character doesn't look or sound exactly its game's counterpart, that's it. There is no nuance, no critical thinking.\n\nEntertainment has become an ideological battlefield. Last weeks we saw American conservatives getting triggered at M&M's colors for allegedly supporting the LGBTQ movement, and at Xbox's new economic sleep mode, being allegedly a vector to teach children about global warming. It would be hilarious if it did not get that much traction. TLOU has been under fire for similar ideological reasons, let's not ignore that. TLOU part 2 was review bombed at the second users could leave a review, the day the game shipped. At that point, nobody could have finished the tutorial yet. There is another Last of Us sub on Reddit which is dedicated to hate the second game, and Neil Druckmann. It even forced Metacritic to change their policy. Users now have to wait 24h after shipping date to leave a review. \n\nAgain, if someone wants to argue about deviation from the original material, they better be coming with solid arguments. Especially considering how E03 is, in my opinion, but shared with the vast majority of viewers, an excellent addition to TLOU's universe. Given the fact this brand has a lot of politically motivated haters, if they can't develop their point beyond the usual haters' hivemind arguments (desacralization of the original material), I will naturally conclude they are bigots. For instance, I see plenty of people saying they are dissatisfied Joel & Bill did not have a scene together. Haven't they see the episode? The garden lunch flashback? The final letter? Why are they lying?\n\nTaking the first negative reviews I find on Metacritic:\n\n*• \"horrible Elllie casting, \\[...\\] , he has a damn annoying voice and he only got the role because if she is not binary, I hate every moment of this girl or boy, you can't tell, we have to shove the lbtq \\*\\*\\*\\* in our face\"*\n\n*• \" \\*\\*\\*\\* and groooooOoooOoOooOooooosssssssssssssssssss why did they have to go there.\"* (episode 3 review).\n\n*• \"Drunkman said it’s gonna be authentic to game…. Well not after watching episode 3… it’s authentically woke!\"*\n\n*• \"The third series is just a shame! Agenda. I do not recommend it! The dragon showed itself in all its glory.\"*\n\n*• \"It doesn't follow the arc of the original video game and is starting to be full of woke content... betrayed.\"*\n\nShow me someone who can argue how that episode is harming TLOU's universe & storytelling in a competent & compelling way. I'll wait.",

So I’m not sure why being mad that they deviated from the source would make you a bigot. The people who are asking for bill to be straight must not even know the source material.\n\nSo does the fact that they spent an early episode deviating away from growth in Joel and Ellie’s relationship for the sake of a character who they decide to kill off anyways make me a bigot because I didn’t like the episode? What role will this story have played in the long run? Bill left a letter that’s going to alter Joel’s entire attitude for the rest of the series? At least in the game bill is a visual representation of what Joel will become if he isolates himself from everyone. The show provides a letter instead of an interaction between Joel, Ellie and a bill who’s lost his Frank. To me the interaction would be more meaningful than the letter. Letters are actually exactly how the game details some of less important events but more human aspect of the game. Frank also doesn’t even like bill and that’s in the game but, in my opinion, is not very important. I still think it’s lame they just show us this happy go lucky Romeo and Juliet love story in episode 3. Wouldn’t matter if it was bill and Frank or Joel and Tess or Riley and Ellie. \n\nAlso I didn’t need to see bill getting his dick sucked to know he’s gay. For all the nuance and critical thinking you speak of it seems like the dick sucking scene would be unnecessary. We can come to that conclusion ourselves just like I didn’t need to see Tess sucking Joel’s dick to understand they have some sort of relationship.\n\nOr what about the iconic parts of the early game that I was looking forward to seeing. The bloaters in the gym or Joel get hung upside down and attacked by clickers. Does that make me a bigot because I didn’t like those changes?\n\nOr what if I didn’t like the episode because the changes they made do not make any sense. They lived in that community for 20 years and only saw one clicker and were attacked by raiders once? What purpose did this episode serve at all? Yes the story ultimately doesn’t change because Joel and Ellie get what they were looking for but why did we need bills backstory at all in this depth?\n\nThere are PLENTY of humanizing moments in TLOU that they won’t need to deviate this far from source material just to earn brownie points. You can call people bigots to make you feel better but people who know the source material know it’s full of polarizing stuff such as this and would expect as much. I get that it’s an adaptation and won’t be a 1 for 1 remake but this just felt totally unnecessary and too much for two characters who end up dead. Theories suggest bill may still be alive which I hope is true so I can look back at this episode and not feel like it was just a huge waste of time but I also don’t feel like a bigot because I didn’t like the changes they made from the game to the show.\n\nAs for your comments about The Rings of Power (TROP) and HOTD/GOT. If people aren’t liking characters because they are black or women that’s fair to see them as bigots but it’s not fair to chalk everyone up who dislikes these shows for deviating from source material as bigots. I know you said “in general” and “most but not all” but it’s definitely coming across as that’s how you feel. TROP is fucking garbage for a million reasons but dwarves being black isn’t one of them. It’s because they have phenomenal source material and still fuck up making a decent show. If someone says it’s bc black dwarves then fuck them but that show is trash for so many other reasons.\n\nGoT turns to garbage for a million reasons. Being forced to deviate from source material is one of them but women being in charge is not. They ruin several characters and story lines deviating from the source material. \n\nHoTD is really good so far and it doesn’t matter that the Valeryons are black. Corlys and laena were great characters and it made literally no difference if they were black or white. If they start to deviate away from the source material, like GoT, then I will be skeptical about the quality of the show moving forward. Is it because of women or colored people? No it’s because we have seen the collapse of its sister show in similar fashion.\n\nI know the bigotry you speak of exists. it would be foolish to act as if all these shows didn’t have an audience of idiots who dislike it bc gay or colored or women. I feel that deviating from source material is a plenty good reason to dislike something and I shouldn’t have to jump through hoops, as I have, explaining to you why i don’t like something just so I don’t have to be seen as a bigot because your belief is “most people who feel this way is because they’re bigots.”",

You did not even see the act. All you saw was 2 people in love, in a pretty soft scene. No dick, except the one you visualized in your head. That scene was quite casual, nothing that would have irked anybody if it was a straight scene. I find it quite interesting how people can go from \"I have nothing against gay characters\" to \"What about the unnecessary dick sucking\". There's nothing unnecessary in that scene. And there are not dicks either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What role will this story have played in the long run?  \n>  \n>What purpose did this episode serve at all?\n\nExpending the scope of the universe beyond the \"Joel & Ellie adventure\". Making the plot bigger than the characters, which to me is always welcome, and was always a strength of TLOU. In general it is the purpose of post-catastrophe flicks. It's about morals & humanity. This episode, by its dramaturgy, will haunt me for a long time, a lot more than if it was a 1 to 1 copy of the game's chapter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The show provides a letter instead of an interaction between Joel\n\nAnd a garden party scene. Which works really well at painting the relation Joel & Bill had, as well as introducing a much more friendly dynamic between him, Tess & Frank. How Joel talks about Bill to Ellie is also touching in my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Or what about the iconic parts of the early game that I was looking forward to seeing. The bloaters in the gym or Joel get hung upside down and attacked by clickers. Does that make me a bigot because I didn’t like those changes?\n\nYou'll probably see a bloater at some point. In the game you hack your way through the infected quite mundanely. They have made their presence a lot more oppressing for the show, which is a welcome improvement. Regarding the upside-down scene, it's iconic from a gameplay perspective only. Certain things are less important for the TV show. I would have been mildly curious to see it, but this is certainly not a let down in my opinion. I trade that scene against the episode 3 any time. What it brings to the table is so much more interesting than a shooting scene with a simple perspective twist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They lived in that community for 20 years and only saw one clicker and were attacked by raiders once?\n\nHow would you know? That's off camera material. It's not because it wasn't shown that it did not happen. You know what an ellipse is, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There are PLENTY of humanizing moments in TLOU that they won’t need to deviate this far from source material just to earn brownie points\n\nDING DING DING DING! There we go with the brownie points. Ticking another box here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You can call people bigots to make you feel better\n\nI don't do that. I know for sure they exist. I am a game developer myself (big AAA studio). Bigots are never very far away when you have non-binary characters. I call bigot people who are actual bigots, because I deal regularly with bigots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>TROP is fucking garbage for a million reasons but dwarves being black isn’t one of them.\n\nTell that to the infuriated crowd calling the show \"woke\", who have been doing it a lot longer before the show was even released, and have slammed it since the very first trailer. They don't care about the show's qualities, or lack of. They had no idea about the show's value at that early point. All they knew is they would go and trash it, and would do so day one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I feel that deviating from source material is a plenty good reason to dislike something\n\nWhy? You don't develop that point. Nobody ever does. If you want the same stuff over & over, just replay the game, or re-read / watch the original materials you like. I don't like Conan's new adaptation, the one with Jason Momoa. That's fine, I can still watch Milius' one, or better, read Howard's books.\n\nAn adaptation's quality does not come with an almost religious reverence to the source material. To keep things interesting, some novelty is most welcome, and often needed when you transition from one media to another. You have seen plenty of movies adapted from books. They are never 1:1. That doesn't mean they are bad or disrespectful. There are countless great examples, I'm sure you know many.\n\nSo far, TLOU's TV show not only does really good justice to the game, but also enhance its message. You did not have your upside-down shooting scene, but you had one of the most brilliant post-apocalyptic romance instead, currently being almost universally acclaimed. To the audience, this is a lot more iconic to TLOU's general tone than yet another infected being shot at. Again, I take that trade any day, especially when you take away the gameplay aspect of the shoot.\n\nSo you may not be a bigot, even though on two instances you talked like poster one, but I would argue you are short sighted when it comes to the show's intrinsic qualities, as well as the purpose of an adaptation at large.",

I tried to respond to each paragraph you wrote in order.\n\nHonestly you didn’t even really read what I wrote . That is disappointing after you told me me to re-read carefully what you wrote.\n\nMost of your responses are clearly subjective and that’s fine for you to like the episode. There are good things about the episode but the soft sex scene isn’t one of them. I have no idea why you feel that scene was necessary. It’s not in the games and it’s pretty clearly established going into that scene what’s going to happen. “Bill go take a shower.” If you don’t know what is happening after that I’m not sure what to say. If it was a gay or straight relationship doesn’t really matter to me. I don’t need one of my favorite games as a kid being used to pedal people going down on each other. The relationship is fine so you can say “see how you sound” so condescendingly but you’re conveniently ignoring that I don’t care what kind of relationship it is. it wasn’t necessary at all.\n\nBuilding the universe is fine but how are they building the universe if they’re killing the characters that we are just being introduced to. Expanding the story? They’re just changing the story we were already given in the game lol.\n\nThe garden party scene was very underwhelming and I’d have much rather them elaborated on that scene or the mutual benefit Joel and Tess played for Frank and bill rather than the bill and Frank love episode for 40 minutes.\n\nAgain, I’m glad you enjoyed this episode but it wasn’t as enjoyable for me. If you’d rather have that then what happened In the game that’s fine. You’re entitled to your opinion but you’re not entitled to call anyone a bigot for believing the source content is better than what the show provided.\n\nHow would I know if the community was attacked over the course of 20 years? Well because I feel like it would be important the show writers highlight the major events of their time staying in that community. Yeah i know what an ellipse is but why in the world would they skip over anything important happening there? My best guess is that nothing important happened there over the course of twenty years! How convenient is that for this love story?\n\nI can’t believe someone would actually say DING DING DING you’re ticking another box here. Would you care to elaborate on your thoughts or did you just want to be condescending? There are PLENTY of controversial topics to be touched on in TLOU so why did they need to deviate from the source and give us bills backstory. They killed him so it’s not really universe building kinda feels like fluff material. If you liked it fine I just feel they could’ve done it much differently and much better without deviating from the game so much. Easily could’ve found a happy medium.\n\nI don’t know why on earth you’d expect me to engage with the infuriated crowd of LOTR fans. Maybe engaging with those people makes you feel better because it lets you know you’re not a total piece of shit or maybe your line of work forces you to interact with them but I pay no attention to those idiots. I don’t even know what to say to someone who’s upset about black dwarves therefore I just won’t interact with them. Especially not online lmao. If they’re infuriated because the show sucked (is that even arguable?) is it fair to say they’re the same group of infuriated idiots who simply don’t like black dwarves? I’m not paying attention to people that stupid I don’t give a damn about what color a fictional creature is.\n\nI’m not sure how you could possibly miss all the points I made regarding the several TV shows that are an example of when deviating from the source material goes wrong and provides a good reason to dislike something. I suppose you can win any argument if you literally just ignore everything the other person is saying but it’s quite clear that many of these shows, when deviating from the source material, have turned out poorly. Is that not enough reason to believe in sticking to the source material? I get that it’s not going to be 1:1 exact copy but what they’ve added is just too much in my opinion and was lame and unnecessary.\n\nI’m not saying the show is bad I’m just saying the third episode wasn’t my favorite and I think that in this instance they should’ve stuck closer to the source material. You can disagree that’s fine. Doesn’t make me a bigot so I appreciate that you’ll admit that. Even though you carefully clipped and copied what I said and responded to it in a fashion that would indicate you think I’m a bigot. And then you proceed to call me short sighted which ultimately proves my point that regardless of what I say to defend my belief that you’ll summarize my whole argument down to “you don’t like them deviating from the source material therefore you must be a bigot.”\n\nIf you really want me to expand on why I think they should stick to the source material is for fan service. Naughty Dog brought us an amazing game and the support of the fans is why they’re bringing it to life. Most people don’t even know what the hell TLOU is so why does the director feel the need to deviate from what’s provided? They should be making the game to please the fans! And I’ll admit that some are and I maybe in the minority but again that doesn’t make us bigots for wanting a true to source material product. And I may not want to play the game over for the experience. You’re comparing the experiences of reading, watching and playing as if it’s the same when it’s completely different ways of enjoying a story.",

Looks like a lot of people subjectivity is aligned with mine, contrary to your also very subjective point of \"soft sex scene isn't one of them\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I have no idea why you feel that scene was necessary.\n\nPeople in love in movies, books and TV shows - 101. A scene I want to remind you you wrongly described as \"dick sucking\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Expanding the story? They’re just changing the story we were already given in the game lol.\n\nThe Bill & Frank story you got in the game was light in content, but intriguing enough to leave room for development. That was delivered. Some elements were changed, so what? You understand the original story was written more than 10 years ago, and the creative team may want to explore new things, rather than holding their own hand from the past? And yes, it expends the story. Before yesterday, Bill & Frank were just 2 dudes with a past relationship, some bad blood, and tropes about survivalism. There is a lot more to them now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My best guess is that nothing important happened there over the course of twenty years! How convenient is that for this love story?\n\nYour best guess is off target. If you want 50 minutes of people shooting at zombies behind a fence, you are simply not watching the right thing. You don't need it to be shown constantly for knowing it's part of the universe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I can’t believe someone would actually say DING DING DING you’re ticking another box here.\n\nAccusing people of chasing so-called \"brownie points\" is a typical argument of people who are irked by diversity & inclusion. It's unrelated to the media's qualities, it's purely political.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I suppose you can win any argument if you literally just ignore everything the other person is saying but it’s quite clear that many of these shows, when deviating from the source material, have turned out poorly.\n\nLets put it in another way. It's not because you respect the original material that your own creation will automatically be great. And by extension, it's not because you take freedom with your adaptation of an existing media that it will turn badly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you really want me to expand on why I think they should stick to the source material is for fan service. Naughty Dog brought us an amazing game and the support of the fans is why they’re bringing it to life.\n\nFan service is the worst thing to do, from an artistic standpoint. It kills creativity. The worst they could have done was to delve into fan service. It doesn't mean they should disrespect their fans or change everything. It means as creatives, they owe us their personal vision, untainted by marketing. You are not entitled to anything as a fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Most people don’t even know what the hell TLOU is so why does the director feel the need to deviate from what’s provided?\n\nPrecisely to reach out to new audiences?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They should be making the game to please the fans!\n\nThis is probably what my biggest problem with your arguments is. Fans are irrelevant to a creation process. It goes like this, they create, you watch. Don't like? You skip. But you're not at a restaurant, you are not ordering something to be served to you. You don't have a client relationship with the creatives in the business sense of the term. You are a member of the audience. You don't have a creative input. The media is delivered as it. Not liking it is a thing, but feeling they owed you something as a fan is really being badly entitled.",

This is after accusing me of bigotry, being short sighted and being entitled. It’s not entitled to expect a show to stay true to its source material. I even said that it’s fine what they did I just don’t like it. I’ll still continue to watch and if they continue to move away from source material I won’t want to watch because I wanted to watch “The last of us” based off the game “the last of us.” Not Neil duckmanns grand zombie adventure ft Joel and Ellie. If that was his plan he could’ve made a show inspired by the last of us but didn’t need to make the show “the last of us.” Nothing wrong with originality but to make a show based off the game and then go away from the game and for you to feel that fans of the last of us don’t fucking matter is bonkers to me. Why would a director not make a show to please the fans? They can make whatever they want for themselves but if they’re making something targeting an audience (TLOU fans) it would make sense to listen to some of their criticisms. I can’t believe someone would suggest that listening to their fanbase is the bane of creativity or a plague. Do you just like exaggerating this to make yourself sound right? Do you make games thinking “fuck the fans I’m making this because of creativity! I’m gonna stick it to the media!” Cause if so that’s just insane to me but you do you. Again that was never my point and I don’t care about that. \n\nI’m sure you’ll shift the goalposts again and find some clever remark to try and slight me or be disrespectful. That’s okay. It’s just funny how you say one thing then say “I didn’t say that” when it’s very obviously documented that you made these generalizations. The reason I called you out is because it’s okay to dislike the episode for straying away from source material. I agree with you that it’s not okay to dislike the show because you dislike gay people. But you made this generalization and have doubled down on what you said with no remorse and simply playing it off as ‘that’s not what I said you need to re-read.’\n\nIf you’re wondering why it’s fucking annoying to deal with these generalizations it’s because I do not deserve to be labeled as a bigot for not liking e3 of the show for going away from what happens in the game. I do not appreciate that generalization because then I have to jump through hoops as I am now to show that you can actually dislike something that’s gay, not because it’s gay, but because you don’t like them straying away from source material. I don’t understand why you can not comprehend that. I can’t say anything bad about this episode and certainly can’t say it’s because it’s straying from source material or I’m categorized as most likely bigoted because you and others have this belief that the majority of people who have this opinion fall into this category.",

Yourself had a foot in there for a moment, before taking it away and never mentioned \"brownie points\" again. Which is good.\n\nIt's also impossible to ignore the main point of fracture in TLOU's fanbase has always been bound to political points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I provided you a plethora of reasoning for why you shouldn’t have that attitude \n\nYou have provided misreading of my arguments, mostly, turning them into absolute points. I have had to correct you almost in every comment about what I meant. I maintain an important part of people (but not all of them!) disliking this episode have a problem with D&I policies, and come from a larger background of attacking TLOU's progressive alignment, especially since part 2. I also maintain you are entitled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> It’s not entitled to expect a show to stay true to its source material.  \n>  \n> I wanted to watch “The last of us” based off the game “the last of us.”\n\nIt 100% is entitled. This show is not made for you. It's not designed for what **YOU** want. The creative team does not brainstorm thinking \"what would that rando on Reddit like us to do?\". You don't want creatives to work like that anyway. They create something with their own guts & spirits. Dislike it at will, but don't come saying it's bad because the creative team did not match your very personal expectations. Design by marketing & committee is killing entertainment.\n\nIf anything, it's still very much TLOU in the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why would a director not make a show to please the fans?\n\nYou don't understand the point of creation. Maybe it's easier for me because I'm on the other side of the fence. Basically it goes like this: it's not about pleasing the fans. It's about finding an audience, among the general public. If I make a game for ultra hardcore players who love competitive multiplayer games, I couldn't care less about those complaining about the lack of a solo campaign (all ressemblance with existing events would be coincidental).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They can make whatever they want for themselves but if they’re making something targeting an audience (TLOU fans)\n\nI would like to kindly remind you most of the fans loved the episode.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I can’t believe someone would suggest that listening to their fanbase is the bane of creativity or a plague. Do you just like exaggerating this to make yourself sound right? Do you make games thinking “fuck the fans I’m making this because of creativity! I’m gonna stick it to the media!” Cause if so that’s just insane to me but you do you.\n\nListening to the fanbase is very different from spoon-feeding them what they ask for. First, the fanbase doesn't speak univocally. There are plenty of diversities inside the fanbase. In our case here, you happen to be in the minority who doesn't like the show. Then, listening doesn't mean you treat that as a McDonalds' order. If you want to take your creation somewhere else, you're free to do it. Who knows, maybe the public will like that new direction? How would they know without testing it? Your vision of creativity is a consumer's one. I thoroughly disagree with that position. To me the audience are not customers, in the B2B sense of the term. Clientelism is to creativity what fast food is to gastronomy.\n\nIf some fans don't like what I make, that doesn't bother me. What matters is I make what I want to make. I take the risk of failure over pleasing entitled fans any day, even if they are *my* fans. I know most creatives do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don’t understand why you can not comprehend that. I can’t say anything bad about this episode and certainly can’t say it’s because it’s straying from source material or I’m categorized as most likely bigoted because you and others have this belief that the majority of people who have this opinion fall into this category.\n\n\"I don't want to be categorized\", said the guy who categorizes me. Interesting twist.\n\nI definitely categorized you as possibly bigoted, because you used bigoted points. First, wrongly describing the sex scene as \"dick sucking\". A very common bigoted argument, as people irked by non-binary representation tend to overly exaggerate what they see when facing such representations.\n\n Then, you questioned the relevance of the romance and love scenes. Another classic of the bigots' rhetoric, since it suggests the romance is forced for the sake of representation. Which is clearly isn't the case here. It's a classic romance, which simply happens to be between 2 guys.\n\nAnd finally the brownie points, which don't need any extra comments, as it's one of the pinacle of politically motivated argument. You may not realize it, but you do sound quite bigoted. You know what they say, \"if it quacks like a duck...\" If your speech contains bigoted points, I won't take your word for it when you say you aren't. But you probably aren't. You just seem to borrow some of your arguments from somewhere else.\n\nWhat you are though, is entitled. Creators don't owe you anything. If you want a creative input, then become a creative yourself. And if you don't want people to think you might be bigoted, avoid calling a casual romantic scene between two men with a condescending \"dick sucking\", especially if followed by brownie point BS.",

LOL\n\nThe way you reduced that scene to that is, indeed, questionnable. Especially since the only dick you saw was in your head. People who have problems with non-binary representation of love & sex always go overboard in their description of the act. Their tolerance to homosexuality is usually limited to Platonic love. Show an actual kiss, or just a bit more, and they'll feel attacked. Wildcard for women though, if they are sexy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The love scene was completely unnecessary. The romance was completely fine until the love scene\n\nYou can't provide any relevant point to the why it would be unnecessary. They're in love. They have sex. That's part of life. Bill is inexperienced and show a certain fragility for the first time. Why not showing a little bit of it? It's an important scene for their respective character's development, as well as for their relationship's. Don't tell me it's the first time you see a love scene on a screen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You’re the only one who keeps talking about spoon feeding a fan base. That’s not what we are talking about.  \n>  \n>You keep on talking about creatives. Also not what we are talking about.\n\nYes it is what we're talking about. You want to argue you have legit points against that episode, but you said \"**I** wanted this, **I** wanted that\". You make it personal. You did not get your spoon. You thought you deserved a linear adaptation, because you're a fan of the game. That's entitlement, and frankly a poor reason to dislike a creation, especially when the said creation meets such a critical acclaim. I'm not saying you should like it. I'm saying you should at the very least realize you were not the target audience, and see how deviating from the original material does not obligatory means failure or low quality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So what you have done is talk about a lot of points that were never relative to the discussion because your belief that I’m entitled is unimportant to the original discussion.\n\nOn the contrary, this is extremely important. You say it's fine to dislike the show because you think it's unfaithful to the original material, and you would like not to be associated with the bigots. But your point about the lack of fidelity is highly debatable, as it limits creativity, especially since in the big picture, this show still very much TLOU. It doesn't have to be \"canon\". The original game isn't the Bible. It's fine to explore other roads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When did I categorize you?\n\n*\"\\[...\\] you and others have this belief that the majority of people who have this opinion fall into this category.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You’ve already made up your mind that disagreeing with you means that someone’s bigoted.\n\nNo, I'm saying I disagree with your consumerist view of creativity, and I'm ready to die on that hill. Fidelity to the original material isn't a guarantee of success nor quality, not more than taking some freedom with it dooms a creation to failure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I mean come on. You’re gonna say that anything is bigoted lol\n\nYou keep accusing me of that, but you're the one who brought brownie points, relevance of showing consensual non-binary sex & non existant dick sucking to the table, since your very first developed comment. And that after wrongly assuming I was putting everybody in the same box (\"*Damn so if someone doesn’t like the episode it’s cause they are a bigot?\").* Then tried to weasel your way out of your suspiciously oriented claims...\n\nI already told you if you speak like one, no matter how hard you try to say you're not one, you'll be suspicious. How do you think you sound when your complains boil down to personal expectations not respected, and replaced by \"dick sucking for brownie points?\"\n\nI really do not use the word bigoted lightly. I think a lot of people are, especially among conservative audiences, and you did partially use their rhetoric. The first step of not being associated with a group you don't like is to take your distance with the said group. You could simply acknowledge a mistake, or a misusage of language elements. I would move forward and forget about it.\n\nHowever, as long as you don't take those words away, I will requote you, and suspect you buy into that rhetoric, at least to a certain extent. Even though I know your main grief is not bound to bigotry. That I have acknowledged since quite a while already.\n\nNonetheless, I think that point about fanservice is also wrong, and I have provided what I think is a solid counterpoint to it. Unless, of course, you think creatives' input should be limited, while design should mainly be a matter of marketing, to, I quote, \"please\" the audience. That would be a really sad vision of creative jobs.\n\nI'll push that point forward. It would be a lot better to see TLOU's TV show tank miserably, in a failed attempt to make things more interesting, than having them doing a basic but faithful adaptation. We don't need that. We have the game already. Let them take risks.",

You keep talking bullshit thinking the more you say the more you validate your argument. Your entire first paragraph is completely projecting and fabricating the truth of the matter. I’m not reducing anything and my opinion on this wouldn’t change regardless of the genders involved. You’re completely making something up to try and make me look bad. Flat out you’re lying. \n\nWe could tell Tess and Joel are in love. Did we need a sex scene to establish that? No? Okay then I guess we didn’t need the sex scene between two guys to establish they’re gay and In love. In fact bill tells Frank he loves him. Does that not do the trick. Are you still completely unaware of why the scene is unnecessary? It’s really as simple as that. If you couldn’t tell they were gay from everything else that happened in the scenes prior or following then you’re not as smart as you’d like to believe.\n\nOf course I’m going to make it personal when you ask why I didn’t like the episode. Surprised to hear my opinion when asked for it? Just because I feel like the shit they added wasn’t needed and they could’ve gone a different and better direction doesn’t mean I’m entitled. Expect a show that’s named after the game to follow in the footsteps of the game isn’t being entitled. That’s a totally reasonable expectation. Maybe you make games you like and that’s cool. I don’t really give a damn what you feel like is important for creativity. If your making an adaptation of something it should stick to the source material as best as they can. Sure take some creative liberty but don’t waste my time spending 40 fucking minutes on pointless side characters who fucking die. That’s not expanding the universe that’s quite literally just using these characters and then getting rid of them after they’ve served their purpose.\n\nYou keep saying that I’m somehow alluding to the fact this episode was a complete failure which I never said. I think they just wasted time and went to In depth into a story that doesn’t fucking matter. I felt like I watched a Last of Us spin off about the least important characters. \n\nSome of the things you highlight and your response aren’t even related. Limiting creativity still doesn’t make me a bigot ya goof. So again your points being made are irrelevant and unimportant. You go on and on about this when it’s just completely irrelevant. Your views on staying true to the source material taking away from the creativity of the team has not one thing to do with your claim of most people having this view means they’re bigots. And again you just lie, twist and manipulate to bullshit and strongarm me into feeling like I’m a bigot…remember saying sucking dick is reducing the scene which is bigoted! What a joke to believe something so nonsensical. Hot girl, hot dude doesn’t matter it was unnecessary. \n\nYou’ve chosen to boil all my points down to what fits your narrative into that I talk and sound like a bigot therefor I must be one. We’ve already taken this roller coaster ride and it goes nowhere because you’re too busy trying to ride your high horse to even acknowledge what’s even being said. Instead you’ve been harping on the brownie points thing for hours as if it’s not even a possibility. If they don’t expand on bill and Frank at all or make this episode have a purpose other than being a gay love story than what purpose does it have in this show other than serving as a brownie points scene. You think it’s critically acclaimed? Why? Cause it’s depiction of a homo sexual relationship In a post apocalyptic setting. Sounds like fucking brownie points story to me if that’s the only purpose it serves. It’s not like it really helps us learn about what’s going on in Ellie and Joel’s adventure which is the story of The Last of Us. It could’ve tied in a bit more rather than the dumbass garden party scene you rate so highly. Just because it’s gay doesn’t mean it can’t be criticized. And criticizing it doesn’t make you a bigot. And your opinions on the arguments people use and the language they use doesn’t really fucking matter cause you’ve already made up your mind what you think. It wouldn’t have mattered what I’d have said you would’ve twisted it into making me sound like a bigot.\n\nYou’re the one continuously weaseling your way out of the comments you’ve made which were generalizations and a lack of tolerance for other peoples thoughts and opinions. Every single point I’ve brought up you’ve turned into something to use against me claiming it’s bigoted or short sighted. So you were never open to the other side of the argument whereas I at least said that them following the source material (bill being gay) was fine until they just took it too far. That’s where I was drawing the line but you continue your social justice work by saying the sex scene was necessary and I’m reducing it for calling it what it was. A scene where a guy was getting his dick sucked. Are you gonna argue something else was going on? Then how is it reducing the scene when we already know they’re gay and we find out they’re in love later in the episode. Would you have not known they were in love without the scene. Would you not have been able to figure It out? Sounds like you need to be spoon fed since you can’t draw conclusions. \n\nWhich is funny cause you have no issue making assumptions and jumping to conclusion in this conversation. \n\nAlso, since you don’t seem to understand but fidelity to the source material is almost guaranteed success. We know because the game was a huge success and they could follow the blueprint exactly and attract an entire crowd of people who’d watch the show but not play the game. If they want to do their own thing they’re more than welcome to start their own show. Make something original. They don’t need to change the formula for something that’s worked so well. \n\nI’m sure you’ll attempt to pick this apart too but at this point it’s really useless because you don’t come off with any legitimate argument. You’ll just say a lot of things about stuff we aren’t talking about then you’ll say more stupid shit about fidelity to the source material and reducing a scene is bigoted when you casually ignore everything else I say about the episode and scenes within. \n\nBut please when you’re ready to have a real conversation, one where you’re focused on the topic I brought up in the first place that would be nice but I don’t really care to listen to you rants about creativity and bullshit. You used all that nonsense because your ammunition for trying to label me a bigot miserably failed with “dick sucking is reducing!” And “brownie points are a common tactic of bigots.” \n\nYou truly do feel that anyone who thinks the show deviating from the source material is a bigot. I didn’t categorize you like that. That was the precedent you set for yourself from the first comments you made and upheld that torch until the very end where you weakly dismiss my claims in the name of creativity and act as if that makes me a bigot. What a joke lol",

I'm simply quoting you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We could tell Tess and Joel are in love. Did we need a sex scene to establish that? No? Okay then I guess we didn’t need the sex scene between two guys to establish they’re gay and In love. In fact bill tells Frank he loves him. Does that not do the trick. Are you still completely unaware of why the scene is unnecessary?\n\nIt's a lot more complicated between Joel & Tess. They have feelings for each other, but seem to conscientiously avoid delving too much into romance. They are not the romantic type, and their deeds puts them in a lot of danger. By interiorizing their feelings, they protect themselves in case one would die. Notice how Joel keeps going, both in game and in the show, after Tess' death. He numbs himself out of grievance. He's not insensitive to it, he buries that away. Tess & Joel are fellow fighters before anything else.\n\nBill & Frank's relationship is a lot different. Their love scene feels appropriate. Could we have skipped it? Maybe. Is it \"unnecessary\"? Certainly not. It works. You still can't explain why & how certain love scenes are or are not necessary. If I follow your reasoning, none of them are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Of course I’m going to make it personal when you ask why I didn’t like the episode.\n\nYou make it more than personal. You act like a Karen who wants to speak to the manager, because your consumerist approach makes you entitled. This show was not made for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Expect a show that’s named after the game to follow in the footsteps of the game isn’t being entitled. That’s a totally reasonable expectation.\n\nIt does follow the steps of the game. It takes some freedom with it, but it's still very much TLOU material. Expecting it to be a linear adaptation is ill-advised. Take of one anime's masterpiece, Akira. Original books are awesome. Anime is awesome. They had to take a lot of shortcuts in the anime's adaptation to fit it into 2h. If you're absurdly attached to the books, sure, you'll feel deceived. If you have a minimum of intellectual honesty, you will understand why those cuts & modifications were necessary. Especially since both the books & the anime were written by the same person, just like TLOU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>don’t waste my time spending 40 fucking minutes on pointless side characters who fucking die.\n\nSuch a poor lecture of that episode, and to what TLOU is at large. It would be like saying Henry & Sam's arc, or Ish's are pointless. It's part of the universe's construction. Henry & Sam also die. You don't even get to meet Ish in the game. And yet, they are cornerstones of the early game's story development. I actually expect to see a lot more of them in the TV show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I felt like I watched a Last of Us spin off about the least important characters.\n\nBill was a landmark of TLOU1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Limiting creativity still doesn’t make me a bigot ya goof.\n\nNot what I said. Keep twisting my claims. I said it makes you entitled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You’ve chosen to boil all my points down to what fits your narrative into that I talk and sound like a bigot therefor I must be one.\n\nWhat narrative? You brought bigoted points to the table. Again \"brownie points\". That's one of the most usual bigoted argument that exists. You imply this episode exists for virtue signaling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You think it’s critically acclaimed? Why?\n\nCheck the reviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And your opinions on the arguments people use and the language they use doesn’t really fucking matter cause you’ve already made up your mind what you think. It wouldn’t have mattered what I’d have said you would’ve twisted it into making me sound like a bigot.\n\nIf you don't want to be mistaken for a bigot, don't talk like one. It's really that simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You’re the one continuously weaseling your way out of the comments you’ve made which were generalizations and a lack of tolerance for other peoples thoughts and opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see you copy my own words, interesting. But no, I'm not weaseling out. I stand by my claim, a lot of people hide bigoted opinions under the guise of pseudo-objective arguments. It's not a generalization. TLOU in particular has been bombed for that since Part 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>(bill being gay) was fine until they just took it too far.\n\nToo far for you. Maybe question yourself about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>your social justice work by saying the sex scene was necessary\n\nSocial justice now? I never brought social justice on the table. I said sex scenes are mundane in entertainment. This one makes sense for the character building, and just happen to star 2 men. Seems you keep focusing a lot on gayness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Sounds like you need to be spoon fed since you can’t draw conclusions.\n\nAgain trying to steal my words? At least I'm inspiring you. I can draw conclusions, but I couldn't know before that scene the love dynamic between Bill & Frank, or Bill's inexperience. That scene, contrary to what you think brings some developments. Sex scenes tend to be use to reveal how characters behave in intimacy, their doubts, their insecurities, but also their empathy. Or you know, as erotic eye candies. That, for sure, is typically unnecessary, even though not obligatory bad either. Who doesn't like a bit of flesh?\n\nBut that's not Bill & Frank's scene's design anyway. They do a lot more than showing two guys' love, and they keep any spicy stuff away from the camera. Not in your head it seems though!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, since you don’t seem to understand but fidelity to the source material is almost guaranteed success. We know because the game was a huge success and they could follow the blueprint exactly and attract an entire crowd of people who’d watch the show but not play the game.\n\nTry selling a show to non-gamers by saying \"it's a linear adaptation of a videogame\". Good luck with that. You largely overestimate the reach of gaming. Notice how all the marketing material placed Mazin, and his work on Tchernobyl, before Druckmann. That's not anecdotal. Not to mention, again, the lack of creative freedom it implies. If you want the game experience without a gamepad, watch a \"Let's play TLOU\" video on YouTube.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They don’t need to change the formula for something that’s worked so well.\n\nIt's still a story about an outbreak, set in a post-apocalyptic world, starring a hopeless man broken by the loss of his daughter, slightly crawling back into humanity thank to an immune young girl reminiscing him of his paternal feelings. It is still very much TLOU. You are blinded by your entitlement if you fail to see that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You truly do feel that anyone who thinks the show deviating from the source material is a bigot\n\nNever said \"anyone\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But please when you’re ready to have a real conversation, one where you’re focused on the topic I brought up in the first place that would be nice\n\nWhat you brought in the first place was a misquote of my original comment. You don't want to be associated with bigots. Fine, I got that loud & clear. I asked you to re-read, as I did not say \"anyone\" (and you still fail to acknowledge that, cf. my previous point just above this one), you did, then immediately used bigoted point to protect yourself. I pointed at your bigoted language elements, you keep trying to downplay that. Fine. Now you want to pretend the TV show should be what you, personally, expected it to be, in order for your to like it. I got that point too. Mazin & Druckmann, according to you, should be your lawful butlers, and deliver what you wanted in a silver plate, thank you very much. That's entitlement. You are not a creative. You are not a producer. That's not your ideas or your money on the line. They are not supposed to please you, or anybody in particular, except themselves maybe. They are supposed to create, and we, the audience, may eventually like their creation or not, based on the creation's intrinsic qualities.",

I won't let you get away with lies and misquotes. I'll say it again, my point is \"bigots tend hide their bigotry under the guise of other griefs, such as historical accuracy, to avoid being called out\". It's not my problem if you felt included in that group and needed to clarify you were not one. I have simply pointed out the fact that you borrow in bigots' rhetoric and language elements, therefore defending you to be one of them misses the mark.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I’ve explained to you thoroughly why I disliked the episode\n\nI know. I have in return addressed your critics of the show. To which your only counterpoints are \"too much romance, I, as a fan of the game, wanted the game once more\". I find that particularly weak, entitled, and uncreative. The fact you think sticking to the game would make the show automatically successful is also completely wrong, and I have developed why. Non-gaming audiences are notoriously reluctant to delve into game adaptation. Selling the show as a linear adaptation would brush off people a lot more than attract them. Think about why Mazin is put forward more than Druckmann. They want to appeal to TV show enthusiasts. They know they don't need to convince fans of the games, they are an acquired audience already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But I’m not even talking about the same things you are.\n\nYes yo do. You talk about fidelity to the original material. When I counter argue against that, you close your eyes and drags back to my alleged personal feelings against bigots. To which I can only point you towards my original claim. Unfortunately, you clearly have troubles to understand it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>“most people who have this opinion are bigoted.” That’s what you said  \n>  \n>re-reading it a million times isn’t going to change\n\nNo I said bigots hide their bigotry to avoid being called out.

I finished both games in about 2 weeks and absolutely love this universe. I enjoyed the changes they’ve made, with some exceptions which I feel have downplayed aspects of combat which I really enjoyed, and also I think the empathetic Joel transition is perhaps a touch abrupt just in response to the letter, so I agree on that point. He goes from dick to guidance councillor in some moments just a bit fast for me. \n\nI don’t think you’re a bigot by the way. \n\nI do think the sex scene has a different element than you would usually find in a sex scene, because it’s revealed that Bill has never had sex with a man before. It’s a moment where he has his first intimate connection with another guy, and showing his expression, his shyness, etc is a  good way of humanising him, showing his vulnerability, and spotlighting the significance of connection, and the value of the intimacies we may otherwise take for granted. \n\nIt’s not a guy who has had sex with 100 people before, it’s a first timer, who has risked his life to let someone into his home and his inner circle.",

They called me short sighted and uncreative which is fine. Those are reasons that aren’t being a bigot which was my whole point.\n\nI’m fine with them humanizing bill etc etc. i thought the story was fine. whatever reason anyone claims to like it I understand. I didn’t think it was groundbreaking, I thought there were several flaw but most importantly I don’t feel like it added anything to our story. Yes it adds something to the whole world of apocalypse but it doesn’t really add to Joel or Ellie’s character development. The argument is that we don’t need to be 100% focused on Ellie and Joel’s story but when it’s an adaptation of a game based on Ellie and Joel I felt the should’ve stuck closer to source material. It’s okay to disagree. It’s not okay to make claims and generalizations that infer that you believe anyone who disagrees with you is a bigot because they found flaws in the episode. That’s what the other redditor did and proceeded to double down on their position. The other argument is that measly little letter was supposed to be sufficient replacement for Joel and bills actual interaction which, in my opinion, drives home the point more effectively than a letter would’ve. \n\nI just think they could’ve added more to bill and franks story with a different approach that also include our main characters and how their interactions shape their future actions not a letter and a tea party worked into the bill and Frank love episode",

In terms of driving the plot/characterisation further, maybe it wasn’t essential, but then we get into a philosophical/preference based argument about what the role of an episode is. \n\nI’d argue that that episode (for me) was a beautiful story (it made my partner cry) that was entertaining and subverted the original narrative in an interesting way. \n\nFor me I didn’t need it to do much more than that to be enjoyable. I can see that for you that might’ve been less satisfying or successful, and that’s a valid perspective.",

I said quite often homophobia, or similarly bigoted opinions, are not upfront in criticism.

The audience loved it. There is a meaning here. People caring about their humanity in a world where it has no value anymore. A trope in post-apocalyptic flicks, but beautifully executed.\n\nThe remark about inclusivity just for the sake of it is pretty strange. It's trial by intention. We all knew Bill was gay already. There's no push here. Giving him the spotlight was something fans wanted, because they liked the character. I think they did him justice in that episode.\n\n\"Revisionism\" is also missing perspective here. Druckmann is the original creator. Like all creators, if he had the opportunity to go back in the past and change certain things in his creations, he would do it. He went on record about it, saying he wished he did certain things he did in the show for the game, which is perfectly normal. It does not fundamentally changes TLOU's story & universe, nor Joel & Ellie as characters. It just expends the brand's universe.",

Major diversion from the original because it has been adapted numerous times and you want to make something new, and people will complain that it is the worst thing ever made. \n\nNostalgia is the selling force, and it is paying dividends,  but the issue is people want to feel exactly the way they did when they were a kid and experiencing the original for the first time. Showrunners are trying to deliver that nostalgia, but recreating those emotions is impossible.  People grow up, perceptions change, they lose the wonder of their youth, get jaded, and then they blame whatever remake, revamp, reboot, or adaptation for failing to make them feel the same emotions they did a decade ago. \n\nThe difference now, though, is the weaponization of the internet. People want what they want and anyone who doesn't give them exactly that is review bombed immediately.  We've all seen the 1 star reviews talking about how they turned the show off after 2 minutes because of (insert random BS). Like how can anyone spend more time writing a review than actually watching the show be considered fair or even unbiased. Yet they feel their voice has to be heard, so they will shout, screech, and scream about not getting what they want and try to ruin the show for everyone else because they are nothing but grown-ass adults trying to recapture a feeling from their youth.",

And I love that they slowed the show down in this episode, as the next few should be (and better be!) heart pumping. \n\nThey took some creative liberties with the story and in my opinion, it was well done. I’m just happy we got to the same point of the game: Joel and Ellie are in the truck and they had the after Tess death conversation - which I was worried about when they didn’t have it in the woods.",

They advanced the story, still showed every prepper's fantasy/castle self sufficiency.  They even hinted at Ellie's craziness with the trapped zombie and cut before the stab for S2.  While also doing a _lot_ of world building set against an incredibly beautiful and painful love story clearly inspired by the opening sequence in Up.\n\nIt would be one thing if they did a poorly written filler episode skirting the expensive special effects/stunts for a large tank fungus.  Instead, they skirted those scenes with absolutely fantastic top knotch TV.\n\nAfter that love story it was merciful that we don't have the Bill/Ellie interaction, it would have been set against such a more painful backdrop that would have made the sarcasm and toxicity hit much less effectively.  Shoot Bill/Frank's love story even did a lot for setting that theme of _why_ Joel starts to protect Ellie the way he does.\n\nMaybe an hour and a half action scene with booby traps and infected would have been fun, but honestly what they did was so beautiful and efficient, trading it for a scene just mirroring the game would be cheap and unenjoyable.\n\nThis single episode makes the season, IMO, and has me excited for further deviations in the future if they can maintain this same quality.",

This story isn’t expanded on in the game and generally when there is any storyline in a popular piece of media that features lgbtq people, especially adaptations, there will be a part of the audience who will cry “woke” or some other complaint to mask their homophobia.\r  \n\r  \nOpinion: it’s probably the best episode so far and handles a relationship between two men well in a way that is honest, open, and loving. It was not entirely needed but it could be said that it was needed to show that even in this dystopian world it is possible to find love in places one doesn’t expect. Narratively, it was quite a beautiful episode and probably also serves to kick off an action packed episode next week.",

We only have 9 episodes to adapt the whole story of Tlou1, so i want to see the contents of Joel & Ellie fighting and surviving from continous ambushes from raiders & infected get adapted as much as possible. One of the major charm of the game is how much fatal shit Joel & Ellie been through together and very few occasions where they have a short peaceful time to talk, feels very impactful, they bond from those days of non stop dangers. While in the show, we already surpassed 1/3 of the season length and barely any combat action. We watch Tlou to see Joel & Ellie's survival father-daughter adventure across America, not to see the love story of two minimal characters",

How did Bill enjoy gas and electricity all this time? If he was being delivered energy via standard means wouldn't he either be caught by then or had the power turned off? If I wasn't aware of Bill from the game I'd be asking myself what was the point of all of this and what a momentum killer the episode was. Had Frank died in the middle of the episode, eg. during their fight three years in by stepping on a mine by mistake it would make Bill's game character full of cynicism and bitterness make sense and we'd still have some of the action sections from the game thrown in.",

It's not. Period. It's got nothing to do with the story. It broke the momentum after episode 2 had already slowed it. Episode 1 was paced WAY too fast just to be slowed then screeched to a halt all to glorify homosexuality. It wasn't about the story whatsoever. It wasn't anything more than a softcore gay romance. I've been with guys, I'm not homophobic. It's just fucking trash and was utterly pointless. Yelling \"you're all homophobic\" is a sorry excuse and cope for the episode sucking and yall just wanting to ruin every story by turning it into a LGBT propaganda piece. It's ridiculous and perverted. We don't need these stories that have nothing to do with sex being twisted and changed to be sexual for no reason. Gay, straight or any otherwise.",

Stop trying to create something out of nothing. \n\nAs someone who is Bi-Sexual, I’m tired of people dying on this hill of homophobia. \n\nPersonally I liked this episode. However, it would have been way better to see the Bloater in the high school gym. They missed out on an incredible moment in the game. This entire chapter from the game was perfect.  Bill should have lived, I wanted miserable Bill. I wanted the conversations between him and Ellie. It was really a missed opportunity.\n\nI think that’s why people were upset, this episode really didn’t stay true to the game at all, I know it’s not meant to be a 1:1, but this is one of the best parts in the entire game. Like I said, they truly missed out on some greatness.",

And then the whole frank bill thing could've been the last episode of the season just as an almost standalone movie. \n\nIf they released it that way I think the reception would've been far less controversial.",

What was the point of waisting on hour of my life showing a character development of those who died right away without bringing something to the plot? I literally ended up asking my husband about who were Bill and Frank in the game and why they even showed us them. And after hearing the game story I realized how much I missed.\n\nThis tv show isn’t only for those who played and need some background story. It’s for those who just wants to watch and develop story, so for me it was random and completely unnecessary. I gave 1 star",

They could have told a story that ended In frank wanting to leave, hating bill and ultimately getting infected and either killing himself or asking bill to do it. The episode wasn't bad but it missed opportunities for better more emotional impact instead they drink wine and die together....\n\nJust cause people didn't like it doesn't mean they are homophobic get over yourself. I don't know many people that wouldn't cringe at old men or old women or a mix of both screwing on tv sorry that's the truth, I'm pretty sure though one scene didn't take an episode from a 10 to  1. The episode was overhyped because it was so \"brave\" even though everyone that played the game new frank and bill were gay. Acting was great other than that a filler episode that contributed nothing to the main story line you could completely miss this episode and come back episode 4 and the only question you would have is where did they get a car.",

It’s not backstory it’s just a nice well told story that explores the main themes of the show and has a visible impact on Joel and Ellie, also further setting up the ultimate ending.",

They'd love Bill. Because they probably identify with Bill in so many ways... Oh but he is gay so NOPE.\n\nTHIS is important representation. Not all gay, bisexual, otherwise men are stereotypical. Which if you are more stereotypical... that is totally cool. But almost all the not straight men representation I see is almost kinda insulting because it plays into stereotypes. I think its important to note, there are a lot of not straight men who are rather masculine and manly that you'd NEVER assume are gay. The only gay people anyone notices are the more stereotypical gay people.\n\nLet's be real. ALL the ones are literally based on the fact that it was about gay men. And for anyone who doesn't know the game... this story is not in the game at all. But Bill is gay and had a partner named Frank. The gay part is consistent. Its not contrived for TV.  \n\n\nedit to be fair it could be disgruntled game fans butthurt by the fact that this episode deviates from the game a lot. I don't want to attribute homophobia where there could be other reasons. But the show has been deviating since the start... its just an odd time time to say \"NO this is too different.\"",

But did we really need to see Frank go down on Bill in such a cliche way, it was very movie-ish with Frank moving out of picture towards Bill's groin, felt very weird and took me out of it a little.\n\nThe episode was mostly fantastic, I just think they could have cut a few scenes out, or shorten them, it wasn't perfect, but I did appreciate what they did with his backstory. You lose his interactions with Joel and especially Ellie, but what we got instead was worth it. It's neat to have a different perspective to the story, and the game is always there to preserve the original way it was told.",

The fact it's a gay romance is what makes it interesting and compelling, I just wasn't a fan of the \"sex\" scene is all, felt they could have easily accomplished the same goals without it, but it's HBO so we're gonna see some adult stuff I know.\n\nI should be able to vent my very reasonable thoughts without getting downvoted to hell by people who won't even think about it critically.

They exist to give Joel a reason to not get attached to Ellie, and for him to say fuck it and get attached anyway.\n\nThe traps Bill set, their snarky interactions with each other, the fridge setpiece, the bloater... That's not the story. If that's what people want, then what they want isn't the story. It's the plot. And for videogames most of the plot is just a series of excuses to have the player interact with the game mechanics. So it's never going to be adapted as is into the show.\n\nBut make no mistake. There's a shit ton of homophobia to blame. You gotta read between the lines, people don't just say \"hello i hate this because im homophobic\". They say this episode pushes a \"woke agenda\". I mean at some point it starts being a bit more than a coincidence how much the \"woke agenda\", \"review bombing\" and \"LGBT themes\" all weirdly seem to always come as a packaged deal.",

When I heard there was a HBO show coming, I was cautiously optimistic because so many adaptations were not taking the source material seriously. \n\nSo far, they are nailing it. Even though they change some things like Tess’s death and Bill/Frank backstory, the overall plot still remains the same. Even though we don’t see Bill help Joel and Ellie get the car by fighting through infected, the end result is still the same in the show as Bill leaves his car for Joel. \n\nI also do feel like the changes still fits the world of TLOU. I believe that Episode 3 is a wonderful depiction of TLOU’s main theme which is love, it also deepened Bill’s character by showing him grow from the Bill we know to the Bill we see at towards the end of the episode. In the show, Bill gets to have a fulfilling life. Bill in the game however is a much darker person. While he is funny, I feel like he gets a worse fate in the game as he ends up all alone with the thought that the only person he gave a damn about hated his guts and would’ve rather preferred to be dead than to spend another day with Bill.",

Episode #3 came out of no where. This move appears to be done on purpose. I'm curious how many people turn off the TV when this happens. Which seems to be the norm now. It's almost as if no movie or series can get funded unless they insert an episode #3. I find this very sinister and underhanded. I will not be watching this. It's over for me. Episode #3 is not groundbreaking or shattering glass ceilings because this is the new normal. I can't recall enjoying a NEW series that did not have an Episode #3??? Do you??? This coercive pattern in the attempt to reshape society appears to be mandatory and coming from above” - she continues on for a while. \n\n“Episode 3 , WTF what's this a guy porn. You ruined game and TV show with this bullsheet”\n\n“Episode 3 sucked ass a little too literally for me”\n\n“EwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwWWWwwWwWwWwww”\n\n“The world is dying, humanity is on the verge of extinction. Is it worth restoring the human population? LGBT says: \"THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT”\n\n“That episode has nothing to do with the last of us. That was propaganda plan and simple”\n\n“Let's invent and distort the originally story to pander to a small subset of society”\n\n“It was probably the best/heartwarming/important/powerful episode of any series ever. Again.\n\nNo wonder there are so many 9's and 10's awarded in the reviews so far.\n\nSo brave of the creators to take time out from progressing the main plot and story, to examine a diverse and progressive relationship at depth. Instead of leaving some boxes unchecked... They ticked them! Well done guys... Well done!\n\nTruly inspired and unexpected character developments for Frank and Bill, given current year. Although I don't want to risk making outlandish predictions about what else you may see in this series, I will say this, 'the message' is loud and clear. So that's it for me, Three episodes (well 2.5) and I'm Out!” (Obvious satire, rated it 2/10). \n\nReview titled “The last of They/Them”\n\n“3 episodes in and instead of digging into the barely scratched surface of who Joel has become since the pilot, we get the gay love story of Ron Swanson”\n\n“Long drawn out story about a gay couple that has nothing to do with the main characters or the main story and plot. Literally was the entire episode. Nothing to do with the story of the original video game. Such a waste of time watching this episode. The writers added this just to get in their political propaganda and check all the liberal boxes to make a show successful. This show was off to a great start sticking to the story and plot line, sticking to the plot and story of the video game until now. Can't have any tv show without it just being a sermon from the church of liberalism. Totally unnecessary. If the other episodes are gonna be nothing but more sermons from the church of liberalism then this show is done.”",

                "body": "I thought it was a beautiful representation of a caring, loving relationship. I have no problem with the homosexuality portrayed in the show. In fact, I was able to have a conversation with my conservative and religious parents about how and why my views on homosexuality have changed since I was a conservative, religious teenager, so I’d say it was a great story.\n\nMy only criticism is that they didn’t show Bill interacting with Joel and Ellie. That beat of the story was important in giving Joel a reason to care about Ellie, and I didn’t feel like the letter at the end of the episode had the same impact, but I’m always willing to consider that I’m just coming at this as a fan of the game, and that might skew my view.\n\nI’d love to hear about this episode from someone who had never played the game before watching it (ideally someone who isn’t a homophobic Christian like my parents).\n\nI also felt like this episode skewed a little too much into giving feelings of “happiness.” Bill in the game was lot angrier, a lot more bitter, and that fit with the world that they were living in. The game of the Last of Us is pretty much all dour, with the only bright spots being the building relationship between Joel and Ellie, and I feel like having a bottle episode so near the beginning of the season takes away from the momentum they were building with their lead characters. Bottle episodes are usually reserved for later seasons, allowing for a deeper exploration of the characters we already know, and since we don’t know Bill and Frank, it seems out of place. Like the show maybe hasn’t earned that yet, unless you already know the characters from the game, or are already in need of a detour from the two leads.\n\nThat being said, I appreciate that they portrayed Bill and Frank in a healthy relationship, which is a departure from the game. I loved Bill and his story in the game, and I found that story to be more tragic in a lot of ways. But it certainly wasn’t healthy. When it comes to representation, a lot of media portray homosexual relationships in a tragic, or immature, or abusive way, and I think that was a criticism levied at Bill’s story from the game (even though I think the story was originally written from a place of love). So it was nice to see two gay men who love each other, and not for just a night, but for almost 20 years. I think that’s cool.\n\nPerhaps my criticisms of the episode will fade as the season goes on. I’m just mainly here for Joel and Ellie, and I want to get as much time with them as I can before the season is over. Not that I don’t love side stories. But I hope we don’t have another episode where we spend the vast majority of it focused on other characters.\n\n\nP.S. My favorite part of the episode is when the raiders attack. We see the Bill wake up to the fire and screaming, then we switch to Frank going to the window, trying to figure out what’s going on. That instant when he turns around and sees Bill is already gone, I was like, “Fuck yeah 😎 “\n\nI don’t know why Bill would be standing out in the middle of the street waiting to get shot, but that moment in the bedroom was sick. It drove home Bill’s motivation to protect Frank. When shit hit the fan, he was ready. I loved that.",

I never played the game so I guess I’m bias on that end.\n\nI enjoyed Episode 3 and the other episodes for different reasons. I think this doubles down on the raw human emotional side of the show whilst the others were more action-oriented. \n\nWhat makes someone’s opinion homophobic for this episode can be found in their wording. \n\nFor example, one review said they HATED this episode because of this side story that had nothing to do with this couple. They would rather see the story get expanded on the mother and baby that were found dead. \n\nBut, is the mother and baby really part of the main story? This review directly contradicted its own logic, so the underlying reason is that they’re uncomfortable with their sexuality/scared of gay people.",

It added nothing to the overall story. You could’ve skipped their whole story and just watched the Joel and Ellie scenes and still wouldn’t have missed anything. The episode shouldn’t deserve a 1 star, but it definitely wasn’t a 10.",
