A decent game with fun gameplay, but pretty unsatisfying for an entire story. Wrong again. I was pretty taken a back when that switch happened and took me a bit to wrestle with the idea that I'd be playing the entire first half of the game again from this perspective (because of DAY 1 popping), considering I know where it ends, but I love the way they made Abby human. I think they could've done a better job and made her less of a dick and have a few more human moments (Ellie had a ton of human moments to get past her combative personality in the first game), but it was a hell of an attempt and something I can't stop discussing with people open for discussion.

It's not about agreeing with the lifestyle. If anyone doesn't like the game *solely* because they play as a woman, a gay woman, a buff woman, or because it has a trans character...you're a phobe and a dick and you shouldn't have a platform to spew hate under the guise of \"not agreeing with the lifestyle\"\n\n\nand for the reactionaries that are gonna jump and accuse me of saying people who don't like the game are phobes...no, that's not what I'm saying. **Disliking the game is perfectly valid**. Hating that Joel died..valid. Disliking the structure that forces you to play as the antagonist for a significant chuck...valid. the fucking need to pickup so much little shit...valid. There's lots of reasons, many I disagree with, but you know it's just a videogame and discussion is healthy, but plenty of valid reasons. There's criticism and disappointment. Then there's being a bigot. We should welcome EVERYONE that wants to talk about elements of the game or what people didn't like or what they would do different and we should SHUN everyone that disguises their toxic hate as \"reviews\"\n\n\nThey shouldn't be afraid to take a strong stance anyway since the game is breaking all sorts of records in sales too. The hate is the minority, and PLUS if we successfully get this point across, more people who want to debate the game will feel comfortable knowing that we're welcome to listen non-hate stuff. If we weed out the bad guys from the discussion, people won't feel so defensive about not liking the game. Tolerating hate is not tolerance.\n\n\nE: bigots, I‚Äôm not taking the bait.

There are criticisms that ive seen but typically its nothing to do with the story, writing or MUH JOEL.\n\nThis covers a great point though. People finish the game but without an open mind they dont truly appreciate it. Its just as thought provocation and emotionally rich as the first game. Its sad that people are robbing themselves of that experience. But then again, the people who are upset seem to be those who hero worshipped Joel. And they probably missed the point of the 1st game.",

The things he did in the name of survival were allegedly so horrifying that his brother was deeply traumatized and straight up said that death would have been preferable.\n\nJoel isn't any better than any of the shitheads he kills during the game. He's a terrible person in a world that incentivizes terrible behavior. The only reason he appears sympathetic during the game is because of his relationship with Ellie. Having one person he gives half a shit about is literally his only redeeming quality, and even that ultimately just becomes one more justification for him to slaughter a bunch of people.",

Then there is of course the opposite end of wanting Ellie to lean into revenge full tilt all the way down to killing Abby, regardless of whether or not that will actually help her heal.

Gives much more weight to the decisions that are made. Also makes you question who the good and bad guys really are.\n\nI didn't necessarily agree with the ending at first, but I have since realized it was the proper ending given the story/message being delivered.\n\nThat's my .02 on it",

No game should be barred from criticism but their criticism boils down to the comparison of the game and current world event which started like 4 months ago. I wonder what would their criticism be if the game came out in February. \n\nAlso I am fine with a game receiving an 8, it's a still pretty good score, but the reasons GameSpot gave is so bizarre.\n\nThis will really piss off some chuds. In before paid reviews and shills etc etc but they will cherry pick the bad parts which are suddenly not shilling apparently.

            "body": "I've got the most interesting opinions from a podcast by Stopgame.ru. Bullet points:\n- While critics are praising the game, user score will most likely be catastrophically low\n- As a standalone game it's marvelous, but if the first game is very dear to you, you can feel betrayed\n- One reviewer said that the first part of the game is exactly what he wanted from the sequel, but then comes the second part... The other reviewer said that he almost gave up on the game during the first part, but when the second part began, he was instantly hooked\n- One of the reviewers said that he can say that the game is excellent, but at the end of the year TLoUII will be in his short list of \"Disappointments of the Year\"\n- The same reviewer said that he is rewatching the ending of the game three times a day every day after he finished the game\n- Other reviewer said that TLoUII gives a new context for the first game, without which it now feels like a kid cartoon\n- Both mentioned that the game is balancing between two states: game being a genuine masterpiece and Neil Druckmann being a pretentious asshole\n- Gameplay is too easy if you won't play on the pre-last difficulty setting\n- One of the reviewer said that combat encounters felt like Hitman if it went wrong every second. But the difference is - you don't want to restart the sequence, you want to see it through as it unfolds. Because of the new AI, every time you replay an encounter, it will go differently\n- One of the reviewer mentioned that he went through denial and acceptance before he started enjoying the game. He said that if you are willing to play by Druckmann's rules, you will be hugely rewarded. But if you are one of those hardcore fans of the first game who think that Joel and Ellie's story is YOUR story than prepare to be destroyed by the game\n\nEdit:\n- One reviewer felt that the first part of the game is a nod to the fans of TLoU1, while the second part is the true reason why the game had been made in the first place\n- One reviewer said that the game would be less controversial if it only contained the second part of the game. Other reviewer said that first part of the game is necessary for second part to have it's impact\n\nEdit 2:\n- The game has very aesthetic cinematic feel during the cutscenes ‚Äì it could be a textbook for future cinematographers\n- The guy who liked the second part said that he got tired of ¬´Naughty Dog's dialogues and humor¬ª during the first part of the game: he felt like Ellie and her accompanying partners are speaking in the exact same manner as Drake and Sully from Uncharted. In the second part of the game there is no such problem.\n- One of the reviewer felt like Ellie lost her goofy charm from the first game and became just an average teenage girl [She kind of lost it after killing David in the first game, so I don't know if it's intentional direction or an oversight]\n- There are some scenes that felt like straight out of Life is Strange and the reviewer meant it in a bad way\n- The game is too long ‚Äì if you felt that Uncharted 4 was longer than it needs to be than prepare to be completely exhausted by the end of the TLoU2",

The game is selling well because most creditable reviewers are speaking very highly of it, because the first game was very impactful with a lot of gamers and because ND's reputation for quality is well known to anyone who owns a ps4. \n\nLook, he doesn't have to like the game and he has every right to use his platform to voice his disappointment, but anyone who disliked the game AND tries to write this game off as a failure are the ones who will be even more disappointed.\n\nThis game took bold steps in the narrative and when you do that with something people are very attached to you are going to get much higher Highs and Lower lows than you ultimately would by playing it safe.",

The fact that they took this long (obv not 7 years to write the story) shows that they really put time and effort into it."
