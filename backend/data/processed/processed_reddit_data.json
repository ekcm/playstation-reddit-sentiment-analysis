A decent game with fun gameplay, but pretty unsatisfying for an entire story. Wrong again. I was pretty taken a back when that switch happened and took me a bit to wrestle with the idea that I'd be playing the entire first half of the game again from this perspective (because of DAY 1 popping), considering I know where it ends, but I love the way they made Abby human. I think they could've done a better job and made her less of a dick and have a few more human moments (Ellie had a ton of human moments to get past her combative personality in the first game), but it was a hell of an attempt and something I can't stop discussing with people open for discussion.

I think the part with Abby shouldn’t have been so long but I agree the part where Tommy blows out Abbys friend’s brain with his rifle really messed with me. I feel the reason this game is getting hate is because it really takes the narrative power of gaming to a new level, forcing you to understand the hard truth of the world of the last of us, that nobody is innocent. That said Ellie is tenfold a better person than Abby ever will be to me and I want to see more of her character arc in the future",

Angry Joe for all his hatred of monotization, lazy publishers etc is going to influence the gaming industry to push out generic trash and not take risks. \n\nWhat's even more sad is if the leaks didn't come out where a multi-month campaign by alt-right YouTubers didn't spam hatred for the game making it the mainstream narrative amongst young YouTube viewers  based on the leaks, Angry Joe would probably be praising this game.

It's not about agreeing with the lifestyle. If anyone doesn't like the game *solely* because they play as a woman, a gay woman, a buff woman, or because it has a trans character...you're a phobe and a dick and you shouldn't have a platform to spew hate under the guise of \"not agreeing with the lifestyle\"\n\n\nand for the reactionaries that are gonna jump and accuse me of saying people who don't like the game are phobes...no, that's not what I'm saying. **Disliking the game is perfectly valid**. Hating that Joel died..valid. Disliking the structure that forces you to play as the antagonist for a significant chuck...valid. the fucking need to pickup so much little shit...valid. There's lots of reasons, many I disagree with, but you know it's just a videogame and discussion is healthy, but plenty of valid reasons. There's criticism and disappointment. Then there's being a bigot. We should welcome EVERYONE that wants to talk about elements of the game or what people didn't like or what they would do different and we should SHUN everyone that disguises their toxic hate as \"reviews\"\n\n\nThey shouldn't be afraid to take a strong stance anyway since the game is breaking all sorts of records in sales too. The hate is the minority, and PLUS if we successfully get this point across, more people who want to debate the game will feel comfortable knowing that we're welcome to listen non-hate stuff. If we weed out the bad guys from the discussion, people won't feel so defensive about not liking the game. Tolerating hate is not tolerance.\n\n\nE: bigots, I’m not taking the bait.

The choices were done to honour the consequences of the first game, to deal with that organically, to expand the world, to encourage character growth, and to have a complex reflection upon a relationship, grief, rage, and moral ambiguity. \n\nThat’s...that’s the kind of stuff you see in Tolstoy, not Assassins Creed. Gamers are raging because they aren’t allowing the medium to be expanded to greater heights here. They are demanding that their, rather low, expectations of the genre be met. ‘Give me Ellie and Joel shooting things and being heroes a second time, then a third’.

Revenge isn’t just wrong because of the things you do to get if, but revenge leaves you worse off than you were when you were wronged in the first place.\n\nI mean, when Joel died, Ellie still had Dina, and Jesse, and tommy, and everyone in jackson. She had people that loved her and cared for her. \n\nLook at the end of the game, Jesse is dead, tommy is crippled and his marriage is dying, and Dina left and took the baby. Ellie destroyed everything she had, and even if she had killed Abby, it wouldn’t have been what she wanted.",

I wanted to pop into this excellent community and see what specifics you all wanted to know about the game!I will probably not be able to address everything you want to know, but for things that don’t fit into the published piece I will definitely pop in here and share more thoughts.In the meantime, have at it!

Previous directors left largely because of wanting to go do other projects, not having enough creative control, and similar reasons. Druckmann has the flexibility and control to largely do what he wants as long as Sony is cool with it. After working major roles on back to back critically acclaimed and beloved series, I think Sony, if they haven’t already, will give h and his team total creative liberty like with Kojima.

He also says that the story is just another revenge story, \"a dime a dozen\", riddled with plot holes, and he says that its difficult to connect with characters of the game, and compares it to a DC movie (everyone has the same emotions. in this game the characters [according to him] are always sad and angry). He certainly did not complain about the violence. Did we watch the same review?"

Bullet points:\n- While critics are praising the game, user score will most likely be catastrophically low\n- As a standalone game it's marvelous, but if the first game is very dear to you, you can feel betrayed\n- One reviewer said that the first part of the game is exactly what he wanted from the sequel, but then comes the second part... The other reviewer said that he almost gave up on the game during the first part, but when the second part began, he was instantly hooked\n- One of the reviewers said that he can say that the game is excellent, but at the end of the year TLoUII will be in his short list of \"Disappointments of the Year\"\n- The same reviewer said that he is rewatching the ending of the game three times a day every day after he finished the game\n- Other reviewer said that TLoUII gives a new context for the first game, without which it now feels like a kid cartoon\n- Both mentioned that the game is balancing between two states: game being a genuine masterpiece and Neil Druckmann being a pretentious asshole\n- Gameplay is too easy if you won't play on the pre-last difficulty setting\n- One of the reviewer said that combat encounters felt like Hitman if it went wrong every second. But the difference is - you don't want to restart the sequence, you want to see it through as it unfolds. Because of the new AI, every time you replay an encounter, it will go differently\n- One of the reviewer mentioned that he went through denial and acceptance before he started enjoying the game. He said that if you are willing to play by Druckmann's rules, you will be hugely rewarded. But if you are one of those hardcore fans of the first game who think that Joel and Ellie's story is YOUR story than prepare to be destroyed by the game\n\nEdit:\n- One reviewer felt that the first part of the game is a nod to the fans of TLoU1, while the second part is the true reason why the game had been made in the first place\n- One reviewer said that the game would be less controversial if it only contained the second part of the game. Other reviewer said that first part of the game is necessary for second part to have it's impact\n\nEdit 2:\n- The game has very aesthetic cinematic feel during the cutscenes – it could be a textbook for future cinematographers\n- The guy who liked the second part said that he got tired of «Naughty Dog's dialogues and humor» during the first part of the game: he felt like Ellie and her accompanying partners are speaking in the exact same manner as Drake and Sully from Uncharted. In the second part of the game there is no such problem.\n- One of the reviewer felt like Ellie lost her goofy charm from the first game and became just an average teenage girl [She kind of lost it after killing David in the first game, so I don't know if it's intentional direction or an oversight]\n- There are some scenes that felt like straight out of Life is Strange and the reviewer meant it in a bad way\n- The game is too long – if you felt that Uncharted 4 was longer than it needs to be than prepare to be completely exhausted by the end of the TLoU2",

However, my issue with him is that he is acting like the game is universally disliked among the fanbase. This makes it clear he is standing in an echo chamber because it appears to me the game has gotten more praise than hate. If you watched his news video last week he addresses how TLOU2 is the fastest selling PS4 title out pacing spider man and he immediately try's to discredit it and goes as far as to say his 10/10 Rating of the first game is what drove a lot of people to buy 2 lol. Like christ man you aren't THAT influential. The game is selling well because most creditable reviewers are speaking very highly of it, because the first game was very impactful with a lot of gamers and because ND's reputation for quality is well known to anyone who owns a ps4. \n\nLook, he doesn't have to like the game and he has every right to use his platform to voice his disappointment, but anyone who disliked the game AND tries to write this game off as a failure are the ones who will be even more disappointed.\n\nThis game took bold steps in the narrative and when you do that with something people are very attached to you are going to get much higher Highs and Lower lows than you ultimately would by playing it safe.",

She was never going to be the same lighthearted badass after that whole David situation. \n\nIn the final level with Ellie, she is very distant and during the epilogue, she doesn't seem happy at all.\n\nEllie is not the bubbly charming badass from the first half of the original. She is a person who wants to make sure her life has meaning in order to justify the personal losses she's gone through such as Riley, Tess, and Sam. That's why she is so determined to get to the hospital during the last mission with her at your side. \n\nEllie has survivor's guilt by the end of Part I so when she finds out the truth from Joel, it breaks her relationship with him but she eventually wanted to try and forgive him. This is why Ellie is so wrathful in this game, Abby took that opportunity from her.\n\nEllie's personality in Part II is a logical extension of how she was during the final scene of the original and I just don't get why people think that she is a completely different character. She has PTSD and since I have the same thing, her personality makes complete sense. Those memories you wish you can change no matter what stick with you for the rest of your life.\n\nTL;DR Ellie is not really the charming lovable badass from the first half of the original. She is a broken woman who wants to justify all of the losses she's experienced in her life."

Complains of main characters not dying and having plot armor, then complains that they killed Joel.  \n\nDude then complains that Joel’s death wasn’t glorious enough, like yeah, this is the tone set for the game, things just happen in a more grounded fashion.  And the whole killing dogs thing makes my eyes roll, the dog is trying to kill you, you kill it, might as well be a bear.  \n\nThe thing about the first game is it had nothing to lose, no build in fandom and no one to anger, no expectations to meet other than financial.  This one had all of those things and then some.  I don’t think I have ever seen any other game held under this much scrutiny and picked apart as much as TLOU2.  Good on Naughty Dog for wanting to tell a different kind of story and not making what most basic gamers would want which TLOU: Remastered: Remastered Again.  \n\nOn a side note, a significant portion of the hate this game is getting is because Abby is buff, Ellie is gay, nether are conventionally “attractive” when compared to the conventional female character in a game.  How sad it must be that people can’t handle not being able to masturbate to a video game character because the characters where designed to be complex and have depth rather than look fuckable.",

All these people that haven't actually played the game and are review bombing it just to be a part of this bizarre hate movement against the game... they're doing themselves a disservice by not experiencing it first hand and making their own mind up instead of following along like a sheep. If you play the entire game and hate it by the end, then that's fair and you're entitled to that opinion, but if you're just jumping on the train without even trying it out, you're just faking it for the sake of what? Following a trend of hate? Getting some imaginary internet points cause it's cool to hate and make fun of things? People are allowed to like, love, dislike or hate this game, but you gotta play it before you have a real opinion. You might see playthrough videos and realise it's just not for you and that's fine too, but you cant say something is a shit game when you haven't even played the damn thing.
